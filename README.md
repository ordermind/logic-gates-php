# logic-gates

This is a generic library that provides logic gates for use by other libraries. It is possible to use the output value of one gate as an input value to another, and thus nesting the gates indefinitely.

Currently supported gates:

- [AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate)
- [NAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate)
- [OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR_gate)
- [NOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOR_gate)
- [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate)
- [NOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT_gate)
